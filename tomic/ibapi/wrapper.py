        lastFilledPrice:float - The last price of the shares that have been executed. This parameter is valid only if the filled parameter value is greater than zero. Otherwise, the price parameter will be zero.
        clientId:int - The ID of the client (or TWS) that placed the order. Note that TWS orders have a fixed clientId and orderId of 0 that distinguishes them from API orders.
